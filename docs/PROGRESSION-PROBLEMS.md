# Progression Problems

These are things that we need to reconcile in the theoretical design of our systems here.

1. How do we track and define play styles to award different traits?
2. How do we resolve `Trait` conflicts.  
  - IE, what if we have a trait that improves Charisma scaling, but a different traits that reduces it? Are they multiplicative, additive? Is this a system in it's own? (like, do some traits add, and others multiply?)
3. What is the XP "economy"? Like, what effects leveling up, how does that scale, how are points awarded, etc.  This likely needs to be it's own system that has defined interactions between the other systems, but we don't have anything mapped out for this yet.
